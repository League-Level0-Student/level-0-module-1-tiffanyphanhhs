1. Fill in the blanks
String favoriteHobby = "programming";
String numberOfToes = 10;
String degreesInARightAngle = 90;
String myAge = 15;
String Program = "Java";
double number = 3.14159;

2. Initialize these variables...
    String whatIWantToBeWhenIGrowUp="Game Designer";
    int facebookFriends = 45;
    String myBirthday = "06/16";
    int sidesInATriangle = 3;
    
3. Declare and initialize variables for...
    ­ what you got for your birthday
    String whatIGotForMyBirthday  = "Gift Card";
    ­ the last meal you ate
    String lastMeal = "Rice and Pork";
    ­ what time you go to bed
    String timeYouGoToBed = "11:00";
    ­ how many Robot programs you have written
    int programs = 10;
    
    1. Complete the for loop below so that it prints out the numbers 1­10.
for(int i = 1; i < 10; i++ )
{ 
	JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,+i);
}

2. Complete the for loop below so that it counts down and prints out 75 to 50.
for(int i = 0; i < 75 ; i--)
{ 
	JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,+i);
}

3. Describe briefly what each part of the for loop does: 
for( a ; b ; c )
{               } 
a) Determine what's variable is
b) Number of loops 
c) Decrease or Increase of what's inside the loop 

   1. Declare a string variable and initialize it to “yes”. If the string is equal to yes, print “happy” otherwise print
“sad”. Then print "Wednesday".
			 String string = "yes";
			 if (string.equals("yes") ){
			JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "happy");
		}

		else{
			JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "sad");
		}
	JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Wednesday");
	
	What happense if you set the string variable to "no"? 
	Then, it'll print sad and then, Wednesday.
	
	2. Declare an int variable to hold your age and initialize its value. If you are under 20, print “It’s so great being
young”, otherwise print “Don’t you wish you were young!”
	int age = 15;
	 if (age == 15 ){
			JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "It's so great being young");
		}

		else{
			JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Don't you wish you were young!");
		}
	3. Make an input pop­up to ask the user which animal they like. If the user types “dog”, print “Dogs go woof”,
otherwise if they type “cat”, print “Cats go meow” ....and so on with other animals. If you do not have code for
the animal they type, print “I don’t know that animal.

	String animal = JOptionPane.showInputDialog(null,"What is their favorite animal?");
	 if (String.equals ("dog")){
			JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Dogs go woof");
		}

		else{
			 if (String.equals ("cat")){
			JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Cats go meow");
		}

		else{
			JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "I don't know that animal");
		}
		}
